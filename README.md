# Inventory Frontend (minimal scaffold)

This is a minimal React + Vite frontend scaffold for the Inventory App WBS. It includes a mock auth service, pages for Dashboard, Customers, Distributors, Warehouse, and Reports, plus a small test.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Wyatt\OneDrive\Desktop\SkillBadgeExam
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run tests:

```powershell
npm run test
```

Notes:
- This frontend uses a mock in-memory API (`src/services/api.js`) and mock auth (`src/services/auth.js`). Replace with real API calls when backend is available.
- The scaffold focuses on FE tasks in the WBS: routes, auth, dashboard, modules, reports.
